<h1>How People Learn</h1>
<p> Carol Dweck, in her lecture, “How to help every child fulfil their potential”, starts with the premise that we all know how to <br />
  learn from the day we were born. From that point on, we begin to be sorted into two categories: a growth mindset or a fixed mindset. <br />
  A person with a growth mindset believes that intelligence is something that can be developed while a person with a fixed mindset <br />
  believes that intelligence is a fixed trait that you have no control over. Dweck sets out the following differences between the <br />
  two types of mindsets:</p>
  
  <h4>Growth Mindsets</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Learn at all costs</li>
    <li>	Work hard, effort is key</li>
    <li>	Will learn from mistakes and confront deficiencies</li>
  </ul>
				
  <h4>Fixed Mindsets</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Will try to look smart at all costs</li>
    <li>	Believe you shouldn’t need effort, it should come naturally</li>
    <li>	Will try to hide mistakes and deficiencies</li>
  </ul>

<p> Dweck goes on to say that the growth mindset can be taught. And teaching it causes improvement in learning.</p>

<p>Derek Muller of Veritasium examines preconceived notions and wrong ideas that people have about a variety of facts. <br />
  By putting together video snippets of, sometimes hilariously, wrong answers followed by the correct answer, he believes <br />
  people are more likely to remember. I call this the “mind blown” technique of teaching. Muller draws a distinction <br />
  between unknowledgable and unintelligent. The people he interviews in his <q>Misconception</q> series start out as <br />
  unknowledgable on a topic but end up remembering the correct information in the end because of the style of presentation. </p>
  <p> Both Dweck and Veritasium believe that people can be taught to process information and learn with greater success.</p>
